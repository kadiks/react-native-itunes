# iTunes React Native - NOT MAINTAINED - Contact the author to take over

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-itunes.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-itunes)
![npm dl](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/react-native-itunes.svg)

Access your iTunes library (iOS only)

## [Example project](https://github.com/kadiks/rnitunesdemo)

For RN older than 0.40.0, use the release 0.4.2+ of this library

If you have questions, ask them on Twitter [@kadiks](https://twitter.com/kadiks)

## Installation

In the command line, first you need to install react-native-itunes:

```shell
npm install react-native-itunes --save
```

### Permissions - iOS 10

- Add the key *Privacy - Apple Music usage Description* `NSAppleMusicUsageDescription` in your Info.plist with a description: `$(PRODUCT_NAME) wants access to your Music library`

## Automatically link

#### With React Native 0.27+

```shell
react-native link react-native-itunes
```

#### With older versions of React Native

You need [`rnpm`](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm) (`npm install -g rnpm`)

```shell
rnpm link react-native-itunes
```

## Manually link

In XCode, in the project navigator, right click Libraries ➜ Add Files to [your project's name] Go to node_modules ➜ react-native-itunes and add the .xcodeproj file

In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add the lib*.a from the react-native-itunes project to your project's Build Phases ➜ Link Binary With Libraries Click .xcodeproj file you added before in the project navigator and go the Build Settings tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic'). Look for Header Search Paths and make sure it contains both ```$(SRCROOT)/../react-native/React``` and ```$(SRCROOT)/../../React``` - mark both as recursive.

Run your project (Cmd+R)

iTunes.getPlaylists().then(playlists => {
  console.log(playlists);
});

```js
import iTunes from 'react-native-itunes';

iTunes.getTracks({
  query: {
    title: 'digital',

## API

### getArtists()

Returns [String] of artists

`[DEPRECATED]` use `getCurrentTrack()` instead

### getCurrentTrack({ playerType = "application", includeArtwork = false })

Returns a Promise that resolves to an `TrackItem` with additional properties: `currentPlayTime` and `artwork` or `null` if there is no track played.

The property playerType can be `application` or `system`.
By setting the property `includeArtwork` to `false` you can save some memory resources.

  albumTitle: string,
  duration: number,
  albumArtist: string,

## Known bugs

### Unplayable tracks

For some reasons some tracks are not playing while they can be searched. If you have a clue why, please share.

### Playlist tracks

Some playlist tracks cannot be played. Maybe those which are not cached.
Might be related to first bug, but the first bug does not through a warning
Investigating to flag them as unplayable before getting an error...

### Negative persistent IDs

Persistent IDs are `uint64_t (unsigned long long)`, a basic conversion to int turn them into negative number.
